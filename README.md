# bioi4870
Code Depository for BIOI4870 Final Project: Antibiotic Resistant E. coli Sequence Read Database

Link: http://odin.unomaha.edu/~csandall/webpage.php

The purpose of this webpage is to create a MySQL database for the sequence reads and assemblies of antibiotic resistant
E. coli. Technologies used were Python, PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and MySQL. The challenges of implementing such a database
are ones of size and speed, by linking the user to existing NCBI resources like RefSeq and the SRA, our goal is to lower the
size constrains of such a project.
